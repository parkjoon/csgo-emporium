# CSGO Emporium Backend
------------------------------

CSGO Emporium is a new automated betting system for the popular Valve game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO). We aim to utilize automated bots as fast, reliable, and cheap middlemen to make betting safer and easier!

This repository holds the pure backend code, including database management, misc. scripts, and core bot logic.

Future note: Perhaps build code from scratch that utilizes web interfacing with Steam using a sturdier language.

## Development
1. Setup a virtualenv outside this directory (might wanna use [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/))
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. #shipit
